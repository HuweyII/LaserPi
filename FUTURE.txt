Laser Pi

Things that need to be done in the future.

--Move autolaser function into thread.  Make it stop and start via R key via variable instead of sitting a loop and needing CTRL-c to exit loop.

--Make autolaser AutoLaserStepLimit (How long autolaser runs) something that is settable when the system is running.  In the same watch twitch is set via - or +

--Make a veriable so that autolaser will start by default when program starts

--Make an easy way to reverse servos.  

--Make an easy way to disable remote start via touch switch.
