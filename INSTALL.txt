v. 1.0 

This document assumes a default wheezy raspbian Pi installed and already boots.  And that you know how to login and run commands as root, etc.

The LaserPi will need the following Python modules installed.  (Install with the command, run as root: apt-get install MODULE-NAME)

For the PWM Board:
python-smbus
i2c-tools
The code will use module to calculate polygon points:
        python-shapely

Add to the bottom of the file /etc/modules (This will require a reboot to take effect):
i2c-dev
i2c-bcm2708

Test to make sure the i2c bus is working.  If the Servo Board is connected properly running this command should show the Servo Board (as 40) at 0x40
i2cdetect -y 1

Running the software:
Executing LaserPi-Main.py should start the software and turn on the laser.  It will also display a help screen.  
Executing LaserPi-Main.py -v increases verbosity.
More info on usage in README.md

IMPORTANT: Servos can be reuined by asking them to go beyond their limits.  They're stupid that way.  Servo limits are controled by the following variables in the LaserPi-Main.py file.  I suggest that the first time you run the software you use the a, s, d, f  slowly and carefully keys to drive your servos to their limits and make sure the software isn’t going to let them go too far.  The standard settings (shown below) should be safe for most servos, but you should make sure.
azirightlimit, azileftlimit, alttoplimit, altbottomlimit
