These instructions are intended for a RaspberryPi B+
   -If using any other type of Pi the pin numbers below will be incorrect.


Parts list (links at end of document):
1x RaspberryPi B+
1x MicroSD card (size doesn’t matter)
1x Adafruit 16-Channel 12-bit PWM/Servo Driver - I2C interface - PCA9685

1x Adafruit 5V 4A switching power supply
1x Adafruit Female DC Power adapter - 2.1mm jack to screw terminal block
1x Electrolytic Capacitor (≥1000uF  ≥16v)
2x 180 degree digital mini servo
1x Laser module (less than 5mW. 2.6~5 VDC)
1x Extra male headers for servo board
Good quality double sided tape.  I recommend Scotch Exterior Mounting Tape
Various wires, zip ties, double sided tape, project box

Hardware Arrangement
Really put this in any sort of box you want.  I used a radio shack project box in the end but for most of the project I just had the Pi in a Pi case and the Azi servo clamped in a PanaVise.  With the PWM board rubber banded to the whole thing.


When building the servo stack make sure to maintain proper orientation.  The side of the servo where the wire exits is considered the front.  On both servos the front of the servo should point in the same direction as the front of the laser.  When looking at the back of the Azi servo the Alt servo should be mounted so that the laser will be to the RIGHT of the stack.  (Said another way; When looking down on the Alt servo output shaft counter clockwise rotation should cause the laser to point higher in altitude.) Because this is a bit fiddly you might want to just leave the servos and laser laying loose until you’ve got the software working.  Then it will be clear which way to mount things.
 


Mount the largest included servo arm onto each of the servos.
        NOTE: It is important to make sure the servo arms are rotationally centered on the servo output shaft.  You may have to put an arm on the servo and run it back and forth to figure out where the rotational center of the servo is.  The arm should be perpendicular with the long axis of the servo case when the servo’s output shaft is rotationally centered.
Using two small zip ties (or double sided tape) mount the laser to the Alt servo arm
Using double sided sticky tape stick the Alt servo to Azi servo arm.
        NOTE: You should probably remove the any servo label to make sure the double sided tapes holds on well.


Where you mount the touch switch is up to you.  I mounted an RJ-11 telephone jack in my case and put my touch switch on the end of a phone cord.  However after a lot of testing it seem natural for the cat to poke around where the servos are when he wants it to go.  So it might be better to mount the switch right under the servos.  Depends on if you’re mounting the laser somewhere where the cat can reach it.

Troubleshooting
RaspberryPi reboots or hangs when servos move.
        This is probably a power problem.  The servos are pulling power directly from the same 5v supply as the Pi, so if the voltage drops off as much as 0.2v, even for a tiny fraction of time, the Pi might become unstable.  Try a larger capacitor and/or a better power supply.
